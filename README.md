# Bangla-Speech-Isolation

In this work, we modified the audio feature extraction of one of the state-of-the-artwork - [Looking to Listen at the Cocktail Party: A Speaker-Independent AudioVisual Model for Speech Separation]([url](https://looking-to-listen.github.io/)) Based upon that research, we designed and implemented a model that has been trained in Bangla language and is able to isolate and separate external noise from Bangla language speeches providing a clean feed to the listeners. We were able to achieve said results through implementing U-net models and generating spectrograms depicting the before and after of our results.
